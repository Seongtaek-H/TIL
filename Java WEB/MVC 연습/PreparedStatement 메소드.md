### PreparedStatement 메소드

**`execute`** 

> 리턴값으로 Boolean 타입 값 반환.
>
> 리턴값이 ResultSet 일 경우에는 true, 그 외의 경우 false로 출력

> ```
> boolean execute()
>                 throws SQLException
> ```
>
> Executes the SQL statement in this `PreparedStatement` object, which may be any kind of SQL statement. Some prepared statements return multiple results; the `execute` method handles these complex statements as well as the simpler form of statements handled by the methods `executeQuery` and `executeUpdate`.
>
> The `execute` method returns a `boolean` to indicate the form of the first result. You must call either the method `getResultSet` or `getUpdateCount` to retrieve the result; you must call `getMoreResults` to move to any subsequent result(s).
>
> - **Returns:**
>
>   `true` if the first result is a `ResultSet` object; `false` if the first result is an update count or there is no result
>
> - **Throws:**
>
>   `SQLException` - if a database access error occurs; this method is called on a closed `PreparedStatement` or an argument is supplied to this method
>
>   `SQLTimeoutException` - when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the `setQueryTimeout` method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running `Statement`
>
> - **See Also:**
>
>   [`Statement.execute(java.lang.String)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#execute(java.lang.String)), [`Statement.getResultSet()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#getResultSet()), [`Statement.getUpdateCount()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#getUpdateCount()), [`Statement.getMoreResults()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#getMoreResults())



**`executeQuery`**

> 리턴값으로 ResultSet 객체의 값 반환

> ```
> ResultSet executeQuery()
>                        throws SQLException
> ```
>
> Executes the SQL query in this `PreparedStatement` object and returns the `ResultSet` object generated by the query.
>
> - **Returns:**
>
>   a `ResultSet` object that contains the data produced by the query; never `null`
>
> - **Throws:**
>
>   `SQLException` - if a database access error occurs; this method is called on a closed `PreparedStatement` or the SQL statement does not return a `ResultSet` object
>
>   `SQLTimeoutException` - when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the `setQueryTimeout` method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running `Statement`



**`executeUpdate`**

> 리턴값으로 Int 타입의 값 반환
>
>  -> INSERT / DELETE / UPDATE 관련 구문에서는 반영된 레코드의 건수를 반환
>
>  -> CREATE / DROP 관련 구문에서는 -1 을 반환

> ```
> int executeUpdate()
>                   throws SQLException
> ```
>
> Executes the SQL statement in this `PreparedStatement` object, which must be an SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`; or an SQL statement that returns nothing, such as a DDL statement.
>
> - **Returns:**
>
>   either (1) the row count for SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements or (2) 0 for SQL statements that return nothing
>
> - **Throws:**
>
>   `SQLException` - if a database access error occurs; this method is called on a closed `PreparedStatement` or the SQL statement returns a `ResultSet` object
>
>   `SQLTimeoutException` - when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the `setQueryTimeout` method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running `Statement`
